## Installation

### Method 1: Using WordPress Admin

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the releases page
2. Go to your WordPress admin panel
3. Navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now"
5. Activate the plugin

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Upload the extracted folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin panel

### Method 3: Using Composer

You can also install the plugin using Composer:
```bash
composer require imagewize/warder-cookie-consent
```

## Usage

After activation, the cookie consent banner will automatically appear on your website. Configure the settings from the WordPress admin panel at Settings > Warder Consent.

## Configuration

You can customize the plugin through the admin interface:

1. Navigate to Settings > Warder Consent in your WordPress dashboard
2. Configure the following settings:
   - Language and general behavior
   - Banner title and description
   - Button text and actions
   - Privacy policy link
   - **Cookie categories and patterns** (NEW!)

### Preferences Toggle Button

A floating cookie icon button is rendered in the page footer, giving visitors a persistent way to reopen the preferences modal and change their consent choices at any time.

- **Enable/disable** the button via the "Preferences Toggle Button" checkbox in General Settings
- **Position** it in any corner: Bottom Right (default), Bottom Left, Top Right, Top Left
- The button only appears when the plugin is enabled and the toggle option is active

### Cookie Categories Management

The plugin allows you to manage cookie categories and patterns directly through the admin interface:

- **Add new cookie categories** like Marketing or Preferences
- **Define specific cookies** to block within each category
- **Use regular expressions** to match multiple cookies with similar names
- **Automatically clear cookies** when consent is withdrawn

This means you can easily configure which cookies to block and when to allow them, all without editing any code.

### Cookie Categories

The default configuration includes:
- **Necessary cookies**: Always enabled, required for basic website functionality. Pre-populated with WordPress core cookies (`wordpress_logged_in_*`, `wordpress_sec_*`, `wordpress_test_cookie`, `wp-settings-*`) and WooCommerce session & cart cookies (`wp_woocommerce_session_*`, `woocommerce_cart_hash`, `woocommerce_items_in_cart`, `woocommerce_recently_viewed`).
- **Analytics cookies**: Optional tracking and analytics cookies, pre-populated with patterns for Google Analytics (`/^_ga/`, `_gid`, `_gat`), Matomo (`/^_pk_/`, `/^mtm_/`), and SourceBuster (`/^sbjs_/`).

> Plausible Analytics is cookieless by design, so it needs no patterns here — there are no cookies to clear.

## Usage Examples

### Blocking Google Analytics Until Consent

Add your Google Analytics script with the `data-category` attribute:

```html
<script type="text/plain" data-category="analytics">
  // Your Google Analytics code here
</script>
```

The script won't execute until the visitor accepts analytics cookies.

### Blocking Matomo Until Consent

Gate the Matomo tracking snippet the same way:

```html
<script type="text/plain" data-category="analytics">
  var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
  // Your Matomo tracking code here
</script>
```

The matching `/^_pk_/` and `/^mtm_/` patterns in the analytics category clear Matomo's cookies if consent is later withdrawn.

### Automatic Script Blocking

The plugin automatically blocks a set of known WordPress script handles before analytics consent is given — no `data-category` attributes needed on those scripts. The built-in list covers:

| Script handle | Script |
|---|---|
| `sourcebuster-js` | WooCommerce SourceBuster (sets `sbjs_*` cookies) |
| `wc-order-attribution` | WooCommerce order attribution |

To add more scripts, use the `warder_blocked_scripts` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'warder_blocked_scripts', function( $scripts ) {
    $scripts['my-tracking-script'] = 'analytics';
    return $scripts;
} );
```

#### Common examples

```php
// Slimstat Analytics
$scripts['wp_slimstat'] = 'analytics';

// MonsterInsights
$scripts['monsterinsights-frontend'] = 'analytics';
```

### Managing Third-party Cookies

The plugin automatically handles third-party cookies by:
1. Preventing scripts from loading until consent is given
2. Clearing cookies if consent is withdrawn
